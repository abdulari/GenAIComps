# Introduction

[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) allows you to run open-source large language models, such as Llama 3, locally. Ollama bundles model weights, configuration, and data into a single package, defined by a Modelfile. Ollama is a lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a variety of applications. It's the best choice to deploy large language models on AIPC locally.
